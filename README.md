# Customer Churn Analysis
This project is a comprehensive analysis of customer churn, utilizing various classification models to predict future customer behavior in E-commerce data. The primary model used is the Random Forest model, which has shown superior performance in terms of accuracy, stability against overfitting, and predictive performance on numerous datasets.

## Why Churn Analysis?
Churn analysis is a critical aspect of customer retention strategies. It helps businesses identify potential churners in advance, understand why customers are leaving, and develop strategies to retain valuable customers. By understanding the reasons behind churn, businesses can take proactive measures to enhance customer experience, improve customer loyalty, and ultimately increase revenue.

# Conclusions
### Classification Results
The Random Forest model excels over its competitors due to its higher accuracy, more stability against overfitting, and higher predictive performance on a number of datasets. Its feature selection method is based on its model to handle higher dimensional data sets, its ability to work on large datasets, and its intrinsic feature selection method. In addition, the Random Forest model’s ensemble approach to combining multiple decision trees to produce a much more accurate and stable prediction has proved to be a significant advantage. This model further helps to identify churn for future customers in E-comm data.

### Churn Analysis
- **Single User Focus**: “Singles” would be our crucial segment to target in order to mitigate churn. This could include introducing more deals or optimizing services catering to this audience.
- **Onboarding Optimization**: Make the onboarding experience for customers more seamless, for them to clearly understand the value proposition and how they can make the best out of the services or products.
- **Loyalty Incentives**: Introduce incentives targeting long-term customer loyalty to stabilize order volumes.
- **Product Category**: Mobile Phones and Accessories is our most bleeding product segment.

These are the 4 pain points we need to target in order to reduce Customer churn Rate.
